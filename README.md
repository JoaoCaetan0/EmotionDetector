This project is based on 5 different types of arduine modules, including a pulse sensor, a Microwave motion sensor, giroscopic/acelerometer, a temperature sensor and a wifi module with its shield.

Respective models of each:

- Amped Pulse Sensor
- RCWL-0516 (Microwave)
- MPU6050-GY521 (Acelerometer)
- LM35Z (Temperature)
- ESP01 8266

All the components and the circuit can be visualized on the "Circuit_drawn.png" and "Circuit_Pictures.png". Also, there's another repository containing all the web-part of the project, including HTML, CSS and PHP.
